# SMSC
A spectral clustering method for scRNA-seq
1. compute kernels with computeKernel.m
2. run.m is the main entrace.
3. selfweightmkl.m is called by run.m and it autolly assigns weights to all kernels.
4. We provide a demo on Yan dataset. You just need to download the code and set right pathway, and then run the function of run.m. 
5. Folders in this projet contain scRNA-Seq expression data and computed kernels.
